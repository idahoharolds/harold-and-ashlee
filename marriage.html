You may wonder what difference this will make in your life. I promise it will make all the difference! As you marry in the temple and return repeatedly, you will be strengthened and guided in your decisions.

                        <p>One evening, I was listening to one of President Nelson talk about Temple. This was the time I was eager to study more about the Temple as everytime my kuya invites me to attend the Temple I feel that I need to learn more about it and increase my testimony of it. While listening, I came across to one of his invitation to every young adult member of the church which is to "seek an eternal companion". At first, I treat it just as normal invitation of members to every returned missionaries...not until he continued with this promise blessing, </p>

                        <p>"You may wonder what difference this will make in your life. I promise it will make all the difference!"</p>
                        <!--<p>When I got home from my mission one of my goals is to seek an eternal companion and get married in the temple. I  thought everything will go smoothly but after stretching moments and failures I realized that faith doesn't work the way I thought it would be, because what I'm pursuing is eternal I supposed it not to be easy.</p> -->
                                <div class="harold-content">                        
                                    <p>*Only if I can clearly explain through words what I've felt at that moment you may also have that great desire as I did to understand the promised blessing President Nelson spoke about.* </p>

                                    <p>Before this experience, I had tried dating but if not because of our personal priorities, it is because of my fear that I failed many times.</p>
                        
                                    <p>The night after my experience, I attended our online Come, Follow Me gathering which we always held every Sunday evening. While thus listening to every insight being shared I heard a beatiful insight from a beautiful woman and while she was speaking I feel impressed to message her right away as I became interested knowing her. Without hesitation, I added her on facebook and messaged her. After she accepted my friend request I immediately greeted and asked her how's our gathering and so on and so forth then I introduced my self to her. In the middle of our conversation I told her directly that I am interested in getting to know her. We never thought that that day would be the start of our amazing journey. Today, as Ashlee shares with me on how's our story first started she's laughing at me as I never realized how bold and direct I was which actually impressed her..</p>

                                    <p>After months of dating and courtship I asked her to become my girlfriend and later on I firmly decided to propose to her and asked her to become my wife. Our sweet yet simple journey never became easy because Ashlee and I are hundred miles away from each other and we also have our personal goals to purse but we never thought of giving up.</p>

                                    <p>Since then, our relationship is still an ongoing product of a prophet's invitation. Since the day I met her I came to better understand President Nelson's promised blessing. I came to witness the difference it made in my life the day I acted upon his invitation. My Brother got married, my family was sealed, my younger brother received his mission call and one of the sweetest blessing I received is increased testimony of the Temple. Ashlee and I are excited to watch a lot more "difference" that will happen in our life as we know that it didn't stop the day I saw her nor the day I will marry her but it will continue even through all  eternity.</p>

As Ashlee and I strived to recognize those ways we were able to confirm that what we are doing is in favor in the sight of the Lord and we are excited to better understand the difference President Nelson is pertaining about.
