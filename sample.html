<p>Ashlee and I met online through Come, Follow Me discussion which are held every Sunday evening - it was a day to remember!
</p>
<p>When I got home from my mission one of my goals is to seek an eternal companion and get married in the temple. I  thought everything will go smoothly but after stretching moments and failures I realized that faith doesn't work the way I thought it would be, because what I'm pursuing is eternal I should not expect it to be easy.</p>  

                        <div class="harold-content">
                            <p>When I went to Manila and get myself busy pursuing other goals in life my Brother invited me to visit the Temple, at that time we are not allowed to go inside due to the pandemic. So we find a place where we can just sit and enjoy the view, while looking at the temple I'm just amazed with the beauty of it then suddenly my Brother invited me to pray, I was hesitant thinking 'am I not supposed to pray only when I'm inside?' but his faith and testimony of the temple made me remember of the hymn "I love to see the temple" and I just can't sing it at that moment and  understand its lyrics. So I strive to study more of the temple and increase my testimony of it. On one occassion, my Brother again invited me to go to the temple to attend my previous Seminary teacher's marriage. I have to wait outside as I'm not one of the witnessess. After a while, my brother go inside and told me to replace him as he realized that his temple recommend just expired that same moment. When I went inside the sealing room and witness the marriage of a beautiful couple - I felt happiness. My desire to get married in the temple increased so I strive to again study of the  temple.
<P>One night, I feel impressed to review one of President Nelson talk. While listening, I came across to one of his invitation to every adult members of the church which deeply touched my heart. He said,</P>

<p>"If it were possible for me to speak one-on-one with every young adult, I would plead with you to seek a companion with whom you can be sealed in the temple. You may wonder what difference this will make in your life. I promise it will make all the difference!" </p>

<p>When I heard this I felt a burning bossom in my heart then I went and prayed "Heavenly Father, I don't know what difference President Nelson is pertaining to but I want to understand it!"</p>

<p>The day after that experience was Sunday and I was eager to find an answer to my prayer then when the night came, here comes our weekly gathering online and while I'm listening to every insight being shared suddenly there's this beautiful woman which has this glowing countenance who shared her beautiful insight and while she was speaking I became interested knowing more about her. </p>
